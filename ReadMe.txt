CHECKERS

For all my American Friends this is Checkers, for the English, its Draughts! But we won't squabble over such petty name differences, let the name be decided by the winner!

This is a game of 2 players, a challenge of strategy or luck, personally I prefer the later!
The aim is simple, use your pieces to capture their pieces and win the game!

Some facts:

 + Checkers or Draughts is played on a 64 square chess board. (8x8)
 + Each player takes 12 counters of one colour and their opponent takes 12 counters of another colour.
 + The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot be moved.


How to Play:

- Pieces are always moved diagonally, 1 square at a time, towards the opponent's side of the board.
- You play the entire game on the black squares, you do not need the white ones.
- I have accounted for this in the code so you cannot make an invlaid move without being alerted.

Capturing:

- You can capture an enemy piece by jumping over it.
- Capturing is also done on the diagonal.
- You have to jump from the square directly next to your target and land on the square just beyond it.
- Your landing square must be vacant.
- The piece captured is removed from the board.
- If you are able to make a move that results in a capture then you must.

Multiple Captures:

- It is legal to capture more than 1 piece on a single move so long as the jumping piece has vacant landing spots in between. 
- You cannot take 2 in a row you must land and "take off" again.
- The pieces are removed.
- If you are able to make a move that results in a capture then you must.

Kings:

If you can get a piece all the way to the other side of the board, that piece becomes a king.
Place a previously captured piece on top of the existing one in order to distinguish it from your other pieces.
This piece can move backwards or forwards diagonally.
Towards the end of the game all the pieces will be Kings, which changes the strategy significantly.

To Win:

IT'S SIMPLE....
Capture all your opponents pieces.
